Smart Classroom is one of the most potential solutions for smart education in the 21st century. 
By using incredible technologies such as the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, Cloud Computing, classrooms nowadays can analyze 
and evaluate the learning performance continuously. Understanding this opportunity, we build a complete management system for smart classroom applied 
computer vision. Using the smart classroom solution, students can request for absence and be accepted or rejected online by their teachers. Besides, the dashboard 
also shows the summary of the present students and absent ones. Next, the managers or teachers can download the attendance list for further reports, the dashboard can filter by week,
months, year, and each student. In addition, face recognition technology can use in security that automatically detects abnormal intrusions and notify the guards on time. Finally,
the system can track the student's emotions and visualize them on the chart in real-time. Based on this information, managers or teachers can evaluate their teaching performance. Our
contributions focus on three following main points. Firstly, our proposed system can summarize data from several devices, analyze and visualize them on an interactive dashboard. In addition 
to the management system, the dashboard also has a user-friendly interface that can help managers and teachers who are unfamiliar with technologies can simply operate them. Finally, the AI Modules 
in the classroom are also utilized and improved. Specifically, the emotion detection model has an accuracy of 72.3% which is greater than the other applications.
